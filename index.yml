title: Cursed web techniques 101
level: beginner
description: >-
  Most courses about web design try to teach you the RIGHT way to do things. Any
  old course can teach you how to make websites easy to navigate, have clear
  content, and use the latest web features to make sure everything looks nice on
  all devices.


  ...but what if you want to make a website that *nobody* wants to use? This
  course aims to teach you the lost techniques of making cursed websites.
