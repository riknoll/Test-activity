title: Animating Non-Text Elements
content: >
  I know what you're thinking: "Sure these marquee animations look a little
  cheesy, but they're not exactly cursed". Well you're right, the animations in
  this lesson so far have been a little tame. However, there's a simple strategy
  that can really unlock the potential of our first cursed technique: putting
  non-text elements inside of marquee tags.


  Imagine a button that actively runs away from the pointer trying to click it
  or an image that never stops moving. This is the true power of marquee tags!


  To demonstrate this, let's create a simple clicker type game with a button
  that isn't too easy to click. We'll start out with some basic code to make a
  button that increases a number each time it's clicked
