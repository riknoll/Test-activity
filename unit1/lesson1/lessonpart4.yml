title: Scroll Behavior
content: >
  Each marquee tag also has a **behavior** attribute which can be used to
  control the type of animation for its contents. There are three types of
  marquee behavior:


  * **Scroll** -  the text scrolls from the beginning to the end of the
  animation area and then loops back to the start


  * **Slide** - the text scrolls to the end of the animation area and then stops


  * **Alternate** - the text scrolls from the beginning to the end of the
  animation area and then reverses direction


  So far, all of the marquee animations we've looked at have been using the
  **scroll** behavior, which is the default.

  ### Slide


  The **slide** behavior is useful as an intro animation for some content. This
  animation will play only *once.*


  ```html

  <marquee behavior="slide">
    This text will slide in and then stop
  </marquee>

  ```


  ### Alternate


  The **alternate** behavior is useful to create animations where text bounces
  back and forth:


  ```html

  <marquee behavior="alternate">
    This text will bounce back and forth
  </marquee>

  ```


  ### Width and Height


  Let's try to use the\*\* alternate \*\*behavior with some text that scrolls in
  the "down" **direction**:


  ```html

  <marquee behavior="alternate" direction="down">
    Bounce
  </marquee>

  ```


  We would expect this text to bounce up and down, but if you run this code the
  text won't move at all. That's because the size of the animation area is the
  same as the height of the text. If we want the text to move, we'll need to set
  the **height** of the marquee to something that's taller than text like so:


  ```html

  <marquee behavior="alternate" direction="down" height="30px">
    Bounce
  </marquee>

  ```


  We can also use the **width** attribute to limit the width of animations in
  the "left" and "right" directions:


  ```html

  <marquee behavior="alternate" direction="right" width="100px">
    Bounce
  </marquee>

  ```


  The **width** and **height** attributes works for *all* behavior types, not
  just alternate! Try different combinations and see what happens!
