title: Nesting Marquee Tags
content: >
  All of our animations so far have travelled in one direction. However, what if
  we wanted to move diagonally? Or maybe we want the text to bounce left and
  right while sliding in from the top of the screen? Luckily, we can combine
  marquee tags by nesting them to create even more ridiculous animations!


  ### Example 1: DVD Logo


  In this example, let's create a class DVD logo animation where some text
  bounces around in a box. This animation happens in two directions: the text
  bounces both from the top of the box to the bottom and from the left to the
  right. We can make this happen using marquee tags by using two tags with the
  **alternate** behavior set!


  Because we want this to happen within a given box, we'll also be using the
  **width** and\* \***height** attributes to control the size of the two marquee
  tags. We'll set the **width** on the tag that controls the left-right
  bouncing, and the **height** on the tag that controls the up-down bouncing.


  Finally, we'll set a border on the outer marquee so that we can see the bounds
  of our box!


  ```html

  <marquee
    behavior="alternate"
    width="100px"
    style="border: 1px solid black"
  >
    <marquee
      behavior="alternate"
      direction="down"
      height="100px"
    >
      DVD
    </marquee>
  </marquee>

  ```


  ### Example 2: Diagonal Slide


  Let's modify our DVD example to create a **slide** animation from the top-left
  corner of our box to the bottom-right. All we need to do is change the
  behavior of both marquee tags from **alternate** to **slide** and give the
  outer marquee a **direction** of "right":


  ```html

  <marquee
    behavior="slide"
    direction="right"
    width="100px"
    style="border: 1px solid black"
  >
    <marquee
      behavior="slide"
      direction="down"
      height="100px"
    >
      SLIDE
    </marquee>
  </marquee>

  ```


  Because we're using two **slide** tags, this animation will only play once.
  Try messing around with different combinations of marquee tags to see what
  other effects you can create!
