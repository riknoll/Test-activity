  # What even is a marquee?


  Have you ever been to an old theater? Y'know, the kind that has a big sign
  above the entrance that advertises whatever current show is playing? That sign
  is called a "marquee"!


  Marquees are designed to grab the attention of people who are passing by so as
  to sell tickets for the theater. As a result, the builders of these signs came
  up with all sorts of ways to make them hard to ignore. You'll often see
  marquees that are surrounded by big flashing light bulbs that animate with
  different patterns. Or maybe they'll scroll the text across a screen from
  different directions so that the movement catches your eye. Whatever the case,
  theaters with elaborate marquees are often treated as historic landmarks in
  cities because of their beautiful designs!


  So what does this have to do with websites? Well, back when people were
  deciding what kinds of tags should be added to the HTML specification, some
  luminary decided that a website might want to have a built in way to make text
  that grabs your attention just like on one of those marquee signs of
  yesteryear. As a result, we were given one of the most misunderstood
  techniques that you can add to your HTML arsenal: the `<marquee />`Â tag!
