title: Scroll Speed
content: >+
  In addition to direction, you can also control the speed of the animation for
  marquee tags using attributes!


  Speed for marquee animations is measured in pixels per millisecond. We can
  calculate the speed using a simple formula like so:


  ```

  animation speed = distance / duration

  ```


  In order to fill out this formula, we're going to need two values: a distance
  in pixels and a duration in milliseconds. We can give these values to the
  marquee tag by using the **scrollamount** and **scrolldelay** attributes,
  respectively!


  For example, let's say we want our animation to run at a speed of 10 pixels
  per second. 1 second is equal to 1000 milliseconds, so we would want to pass a
  **scrollamount** of 10 and a **scrolldelay** of 1000 to get our desired speed:


  ```html

  <marquee scrollamount="10" scrolldelay="1000">
    This text will move at a speed of 10 pixels per second
  </marquee>

  ```


  You also don't need to specify both attributes to change the speed;
  both **scrollamount** and **scrolldelay** already have default values so
  changing the value of just one of these attributes will still create a valid
  speed.


  * **scrollamount** defaults to a distance of 6 pixels. Choosing a higher
  number will result in a higher animation speed


  * **scrolldelay** defaults to a duration of 85 milliseconds. Choosing a higher
  number will result in a lower animation speed. Be careful when choosing a
  lower delay time, most browsers limit the delay value to a minimum of 60
  milliseconds!

          scrolldelay is increased?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The speed will decrease.
            explanation: Increasing scrolldelay results in a lower animation speed.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The speed will increase.
            explanation: Increasing scrolldelay actually decreases the speed.
          - id: "3"
            value: The speed will remain the same.
            explanation: Changing scrolldelay affects the speed of the animation.

        content: What scrollamount and scrolldelay values are needed to achieve a speed
          of 30 pixels per second?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: scrollamount="30" scrolldelay="1000"
            explanation: A scrollamount of 30 and a scrolldelay of 1000 milliseconds results
              in a speed of 30 pixels per second.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: scrollamount="30" scrolldelay="1"
            explanation: This combination results in a speed of 30 pixels per 500
              milliseconds, which is faster than 30 pixels per second.
          - id: "3"
            value: scrollamount="1000" scrolldelay="30"
            explanation: This combination results in a speed of 30 pixels per second, but
              the scrolldelay is unnecessarily long.
          - id: "4"
            value: scrollamount="3000" scrolldelay="10"
            explanation: This combination results in a speed of 10 pixels per 300
              milliseconds, which is faster than 30 pixels per second.
